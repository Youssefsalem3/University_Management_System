# **University_Management_System**

## **University Management System is a system that allow university students to view his courses , keep track on his grades ,GPA and more and for the admin to add courses or add students to the system and more**

**We used C++ with different data structures,algorithms to create the console and we used files and file manipulation to load and store the data of the system and I used WINFORMS on creating the GUI for this project which required some C# and transforming the functions to support CLI/C++**
